# Pomodoro App

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980. This method involves breaking long periods of work down into several shorter chunks with short breaks in between. Normally, short periods of focus last 25 minutes with 5 minutes break in between. A long break of 30 minutes would follow after 4 intervals, completing the cycle. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)).
